        <h4 class="about-page-title">OUR Philosophy and Approach</h4>
        <p class="mt-4">At MLS, we believe in the philosophy of experiential learning by Kolb (1984). The learner is exposed to real-life situations, simulations which propels his/her thought process. Our experienced trainers channelize his/her thoughts and behaviour in the right direction. So we act as ‘facilitators’ than the traditional teachers. This learning method is known for higher learning retention and better results for individuals and organizations. Whether it is a senior business leader or an engineering graduate, experiential learning techniques makes the learning process a joyful activity.</p>
        <p>We follow a case-based approach, conduct simulated discussions and apply design thinking methods to unearth, explore and solve a business problem. Taking a clue from these discussions, we train budding managers and Engineering professionals for upcoming challenges and opportunities. Our organization has effectively executed various training programs for individuals and corporate effectively, making a positive contribution to the learning process.</p>

What I like most is her unique coaching style, her knowledge about the subject and her passion for anything that she does. I still use my notes from her training and every time I refer those, they show me some more insights on the topics and examples Damini uses during those courses. Keep up the good work and I wish you all the best for your future endeavours!!</p>
